Introducing a package manager into your project introduces a new workflow
around dependencies. Yarn tries its best to stay out of your way and make each
step of this workflow simple to understand.

There are a couple things you should know about the basic workflow:

  1. Creating a new project
  2. Adding/updating/removing dependencies
  3. Installing/reinstalling your dependencies
  4. Working with version control (i.e. git)
