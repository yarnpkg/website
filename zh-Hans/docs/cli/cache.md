##### `yarn cache ls` <a class="toc" id="toc-yarn-cache-ls" href="#toc-yarn-cache-ls"></a>

Yarn stores every package in a global cache in your user directory on the file
system. `yarn cache ls` will print out every cached package.

##### `yarn cache clean` <a class="toc" id="toc-yarn-cache-clean" href="#toc-yarn-cache-clean"></a>

Running this command will clear the local cache. It will be populated again the
next time `yarn` or `yarn install` is run.
