<p class="lead">Show information about why a package is installed.</p>

##### `yarn why <query>` <a class="toc" id="toc-yarn-why" href="#toc-yarn-why"></a>

This command will identify why a package has been installed, detailing which
other packages depend upon it, for example, or whether it was explicitly marked
as a dependency in the `package.json` manifest.

```sh
$ yarn why jest

yarn why vx.x.x

### Query argument <a class="toc" id="toc-query-argument" href="#toc-query-argument"></a>

The mandatory query argument for `yarn why` can be any of:

* a package name (as in the above example)
* a package folder; eg: `yarn why node_modules/once`
* a file within a package folder; eg: `yarn why node_modules/once/once.js`

The file locations can also be absolute.
