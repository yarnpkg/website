`yarn install` is used to install all dependencies for a project. This is most commonly used when you have just checked out code for a project, or when another developer on the project has added a new dependency that you need to pick up.

If you are used to using npm you might be expecting to use `--save` or
`--save-dev`. These have been replaced by `yarn add` and `yarn add --dev`. For more information, see [the `yarn add` documentation](/en/docs/cli/add).

##### `yarn install` <a class="toc" id="toc-yarn-install" href="#toc-yarn-install"></a>

Install all the dependencies listed within `package.json` in the local
`node_modules` folder.

##### `yarn install --flat` <a class="toc" id="toc-yarn-install-flat" href="#toc-yarn-install-flat"></a>

Only allow one version of a package. On the first run this will prompt you to
choose a single version for each package that is depended on at multiple
version ranges. These will be added to your `package.json` under a
`resolutions` field.

```json
"resolutions": {
  "package-a": "2.0.0",
  "package-b": "5.0.0",
  "package-c": "1.5.2"
}
```

##### `yarn install --force` <a class="toc" id="toc-yarn-install-force" href="#toc-yarn-install-force"></a>

This refetches all packages, even ones that were previously installed.

##### `yarn install --har` <a class="toc" id="toc-yarn-install-har" href="#toc-yarn-install-har"></a>

Outputs an [HTTP archive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.har) from all the network requests performed during the installation. HAR files are commonly used to investigate network performance, and can be analyzed with tools such as [Google's HAR Analyzer](https://toolbox.googleapps.com/apps/har_analyzer/) or [HAR Viewer](http://www.softwareishard.com/blog/har-viewer/).

##### `yarn install --no-lockfile` <a class="toc" id="toc-yarn-install-no-lockfile" href="#toc-yarn-install-no-lockfile"></a>

Don't read or generate a `yarn.lock` lockfile.

##### `yarn install --production` <a class="toc" id="toc-yarn-install-production" href="#toc-yarn-install-production"></a>

Using the `--production` flag, or when the `NODE_ENV` environment variable is
set to `production`, Yarn will not install any package listed in
`devDependencies`.

> **Note:** `--prod` is also an alias of `--production`.

##### `yarn install --pure-lockfile` <a class="toc" id="toc-yarn-install-pure-lockfile" href="#toc-yarn-install-pure-lockfile"></a>

Don't generate a `yarn.lock` lockfile.
