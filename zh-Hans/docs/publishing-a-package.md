In order to share your package with other developers around the world through
Yarn, you'll first need to publish it.

When you publish a package with Yarn it goes onto the
[npm registry](https://www.npmjs.com/) which is used to distribute packages
globally.

### Logging into npm <a class="toc" id="toc-logging-into-npm" href="#toc-logging-into-npm"></a>

If you haven't already, you'll first need to
[create an npm account](https://www.npmjs.com/signup). Once you've done that
you can setup your username and email in Yarn.

```sh
yarn login
```

This will prompt you for your username and email. However, it will not ask you
for your password. Yarn does not hold onto your password or any sessions. When
you go to publish or modify something on npm, you will need to enter your
password then.

### Publishing your package <a class="toc" id="toc-publishing-your-package" href="#toc-publishing-your-package"></a>

Once you have written all the code in your package, tested it out and you are
ready to publish you can kick things off:

```sh
yarn publish
```

First you will be asked to enter a new version to publish:

```
[1/4] Bumping version...
info Current version: 1.0.0
question New version: _____
```

Next you will be asked to enter your npm password:

```
[2/4] Logging in...
info npm username: your-npm-username
info npm username: you@example.com
question npm password: ____________
```

Finally, Yarn will publish the package and revoke your session token.

```
[3/4] Publishing...
success Published.
[4/4] Revoking token...
success Revoked login token.
âœ¨  Done in 10.53s.
```

Each time you want to publish a new version of your package you can follow this
same flow.

### Accessing your package <a class="toc" id="toc-accessing-your-package" href="#toc-accessing-your-package"></a>

Your package should now be available at
https://www.npmjs.com/package/my-new-project and you should be able to install
it:

```sh
yarn add my-new-project
```

You can also see all the info in the npm registry:

```sh
yarn info my-new-project
```

```js
