Currently all of our documentation is written in English. Having multiple translations of the Yarn documentation will help reduce the worldwide barrier to entry for understanding how to use Yarn and how Yarn works.

As you can see at the top of our website, we have a placeholder specifically to list various translations -- **we would love the help from the community to make these various translations happen**.

We're not *quite* set up yet (will take a few more days, but once that happens we'll be able to translate via CrowdIn).
