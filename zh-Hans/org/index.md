<p class="lead">
  Rules, guidelines, and documentation on Yarn contribution, processes, and
  community.
</p>

Yarn is a community run project with sponsored contributions from a number of
companies. Anyone can get involved and contribute to Yarn, and we're committed
to creating an open and inclusive community for everyone.

Every member of the community that wishes to contribute either through code,
documentation, support, or any other form of contribution must read and follow
our [Code of Conduct]({{url_base}}/org/code-of-conduct).
