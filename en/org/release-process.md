## To release a new version of Yarn <a class="toc" id="toc-to-release-a-new-version-of-yarn" href="#toc-to-release-a-new-version-of-yarn"></a>

1. Make sure current master branch is green on [Circle](https://circleci.com/gh/yarnpkg/yarn) and [Travis](https://travis-ci.com/yarnpkg/yarn/builds)
2. Ensure your local copy of Yarn is up-to-date, then run `./scripts/release-branch.sh`. This will create the `0.xx-stable` branch and CircleCI will automatically create a GitHub release from it
3. Once the GitHub release has been created, attach the `.msi` file from the [AppVeyor build of that branch](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/kittens/yarn) to the GitHub release. Note that this is **not** automated as we will need to Authenticode sign the installers in the future (which will be done externally to AppVeyor)
4. Verify that all artifacts are attached to release (`.tar.gz`, `.deb`, `.rpm` and `.msi`). **Do not continue** until this is checked
5. Bump `latest_version` in [_config.yml on the website](https://github.com/yarnpkg/website/blob/master/_config.yml#L9). This updates the download URLs (`/latest.tar.gz` etc) to point to the new release. This will eventually be automated ([#187](https://github.com/yarnpkg/website/issues/187))
6. Debian and CentOS repo should be automatically updated with the latest release within 5 minutes (keep an eye on [the commits](https://github.com/yarnpkg/releases/commits/gh-pages))

<!-- [TODO: Instructions for updating Chocolatey should go here - Currrently Daniel does that manually] -->

## To patch existing version of Yarn <a class="toc" id="toc-to-patch-existing-version-of-yarn" href="#toc-to-patch-existing-version-of-yarn"></a>

- Switch to released branch `git checkout 0.x-stable`, e.g 0.7-stable
- Cherry-pick fixes from master branch
- Tag the new release `npm version patch`, it will create a commit with changed
  package.json and tag `v0.xx.1` to that commit
- Push to origin `git push origin 0.x-stable --follow-tags`

## Old Manual Process <a class="toc" id="toc-old-manual-process" href="#toc-old-manual-process"></a>

This is the old way releases were done, for reference (in case any of the automation breaks). Building a release was a two-step process - Most stuff is built on Linux, and some Windows-specific stuff (such as the Windows installer) is built on Windows.

**On Linux:**

1. `./scripts/release-branch.sh`
2. Build Debian and RPM packages: `./scripts/build-deb.sh`
3. Attach `.deb` and `.rpm` files from `artifacts` directory to the Github release

**On Windows:**

1. Build Yarn like normal (`yarn install && yarn run build`)
2. `powershell .\scripts\build-dist.ps1`
3. Build Windows installer: `yarn run build-win-installer`
    * TODO: Add Authenticode signing for installer ([#619](https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/issues/619))
4. Build Chocolately package: `yarn run build-chocolatey`
5. Attach resulting `.msi` file from `artifacts` directory to Github release
6. [Upload Chocolatey package](https://chocolatey.org/packages/upload) (in the future we should automate this).
    * Note: Only do this once the MSI is attached to the Github release, as Chocolatey pulls the MSI via the download link
    * Also note: Modifying the MSI after uploading the Chocolatey package will break the Chocolatey package, as it contains a hash of the MSI. Make sure to always update both at the same time!
