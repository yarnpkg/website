<p class="lead">Cleans and removes unnecessary files from package dependencies.</p>

##### `yarn clean` <a class="toc" id="toc-command-yarn-clean" href="#toc-command-yarn-clean"></a>

The `clean` command frees up space by removing unnecessary files and folders from package dependencies.

_*_ Package cleaning is called automatically after build step.

_Yarn removes files and folders from package dependencies relating to: configuration, build scripts, code coverage, test data, test directories, example directories, asset directories, minified or compiled files, gzipped files, change history, and markdown files._
