##### `yarn team` <a class="toc" id="toc-yarn-team" href="#toc-yarn-team"></a>

yarn team is a prefix used for a number of commands create destroy, add, rm and ls

These are to manage teams in organizations, and change team memberships. yarn team does not handle permissions for packages.

Teams must always be fully qualified with the organization/scope they belong to when operating on them, separated by a colon (:). That is, if you have a developers team on a foo organization, you must always refer to that team as foo:developers in these commands.
