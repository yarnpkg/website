<p class="lead">Install packages globally on your operating system.</p>

##### `yarn global` <a class="toc" id="toc-yarn-global" href="#toc-yarn-global"></a>

`yarn global` is a prefix used for a number of commands like `add`, `bin`, `ls` and `remove`. They behave identically to their normal versions except that they use a global directory to store packages. The `global` command makes binaries available to use on your operating system.

This is useful for developer tooling that is not part of any individual project but instead is used for local commands. One such example is [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) which can be installed globally like this:

```sh
$ yarn global add create-react-app --prefix /usr/local
# the `create-react-app` command is now available globally:
$ which create-react-app
$ /usr/local/bin/create-react-app
$ create-react-app
````
