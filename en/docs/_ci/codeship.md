On [Codeship](https://codeship.com/), you can install Yarn as part of your build by adding this to your _Setup Commands_ in your project settings:

```sh
npm install --global yarn
```

If you are using Codeships [Docker Platform](https://pages.codeship.com/docker), it is recommended to install Yarn via [our packages](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install#linux) instead.
