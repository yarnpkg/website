#### Installation Script

One of the easiest ways to install Yarn on macOS and generic Unix environments
is via our shell script. You can install Yarn by running the following code in
your terminal:

```sh
curl -o- -L https://yarnpkg.com/install.sh | bash
```

The installation process includes verifying a GPG signature.
[View the source on GitHub](https://github.com/yarnpkg/website/blob/master/install.sh)

You can also specify a version by running the following code in your terminal:

```sh
curl -o- -L https://yarnpkg.com/install.sh | bash -s -- --version [version]
```

See [the releases](https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/releases) for possible versions.

#### Manual Install via tarball

You can install Yarn by [downloading a tarball]({{site.baseurl}}/latest.tar.gz) and
extracting it anywhere.

```sh
cd /opt
wget https://yarnpkg.com/latest.tar.gz
tar zvxf latest.tar.gz
# Yarn is now in /opt/yarn-[version]/
```
