To have people successfully develop or use your package, you need to ensure that all the necessary files are checked into your source control system.

### Required Files <a class="toc" id="toc-required-files" href="#toc-required-files"></a>

The following files must be checked into source control for anyone to be able to manage your package:

- `package.json`: This has all the current dependencies for your package.
- `yarn.lock`: This stores the exact versions of each dependency for your package.
- The actual source code that provides the functionality for your package.
