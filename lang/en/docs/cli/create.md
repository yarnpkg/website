<p class="lead">Creates new projects from any `create-*` starter kits.</p>

##### `yarn create <starter-kit-package> [<args>]` <a class="toc" id="toc-yarn-create" href="#toc-yarn-create"></a>

This command is a shorthand that helps you do two things at once:

* Install `create-<starter-kit-package>` globally, or update the package to the
latest version if it already exists
* Run the executable located in the `bin` field of the starter kitâ€™s `package.json`,
forwarding any `<args>` to it

For example, `yarn create react-app my-app` is equivalent to:

```sh
$ yarn global add create-react-app
$ create-react-app my-app
```
