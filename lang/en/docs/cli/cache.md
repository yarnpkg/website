##### `yarn cache list [--pattern]` <a class="toc" id="toc-yarn-cache-list-pattern" href="#toc-yarn-cache-list-pattern"></a>

Yarn stores every package in a global cache in your user directory on the file
system. `yarn cache list` will print out every cached package.

`yarn cache list --pattern <pattern>` will print out every cached package that matches the pattern provided.

Examples:

```sh
yarn cache list --pattern gulp
yarn cache list --pattern "gulp|grunt"
yarn cache list --pattern "gulp-(match|newer)"
```

##### `yarn cache dir` <a class="toc" id="toc-yarn-cache-dir" href="#toc-yarn-cache-dir"></a>

Running `yarn cache dir` will print out the path where yarn's global cache is currently stored.

##### `yarn cache clean [<module_name...>]` <a class="toc" id="toc-yarn-cache-clean" href="#toc-yarn-cache-clean"></a>

Running this command will clear the global cache. It will be populated again the
next time `yarn` or `yarn install` is run. Additionally, you can specify one or more packages that you want to clean.

### Change the cache path for yarn <a class="toc" id="toc-change-the-cache-path-for-yarn" href="#toc-change-the-cache-path-for-yarn"></a>

Set `cache-folder` config value to configure the cache directory.

```sh
yarn config set cache-folder <path>
```

You can also specify the cache directory by flag `--cache-folder`:

```sh
yarn <command> --cache-folder <path>
```

You can also specify the cache directory by environment variable `YARN_CACHE_FOLDER`:

```sh
YARN_CACHE_FOLDER=<path> yarn <command>
```

Yarn will also respect `cache=<path>` in `.npmrc` for compatibility with npm.
