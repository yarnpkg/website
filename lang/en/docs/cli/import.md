<p class="lead">Generates `yarn.lock` from an existing npm-installed `node_modules` folder.</p>

##### `yarn import` <a class="toc" id="toc-yarn-import" href="#toc-yarn-import"></a>

This command assists the migration of projects currently relying on `npm-shrinkwrap.json`,
minimizing the differences between the lockfile and the existing dependency tree
as best as it can.

### Motivation <a class="toc" id="toc-motivation" href="#toc-motivation"></a>

Many projects currently use `npm shrinkwrap` or check their `node_modules` into
source control because they have fragile dependency trees. These projects can’t
easily migrate to Yarn, because `yarn install` could produce a wildly different
logical dependency tree. Not all trees can be represented by Yarn’s `yarn.lock`,
and some valid trees will be automatically deduped upon install. These nuances
and others present a significant barrier to manual migration.

`yarn import` aims to alleviate this challenge by generating a `yarn.lock` file
using the versions found inside `node_modules` according to normal `require.resolve()`
resolution rules. In cases where the Yarn resolution mechanism can’t satisfy the
existing dependency tree identically, alerts will be made so that you may manually
review the changes. The existing `node_modules` tree will be checked for validity
beforehand, and the resultant lockfile should be `yarn install`able without any
surprises (failed compatibility, unresolvable dependencies, auto-dedupes, etc.)
