<p class="lead">List installed packages.</p>

##### `yarn list` <a class="toc" id="toc-yarn-list" href="#toc-yarn-list"></a>

```sh
yarn list
```

The `yarn list` command mimics the expected Unix behavior of listing. In Yarn, the `list`
command lists all dependencies for the current working directory by referencing all
package manager meta data files, which includes a project's dependencies.

```
yarn list vx.x.x
├─ package-1@1.3.3
├─ package-2@5.0.9
│  └─ package-3@^2.1.0
└─ package-3@2.7.0
```

##### `yarn list [--depth] [--pattern]` <a class="toc" id="toc-yarn-list-depth-pattern" href="#toc-yarn-list-depth-pattern"></a>

By default, all packages and their dependencies will be displayed. To restrict the depth of the
dependencies, you can add a flag, `--depth`, along with the desired level to the `list` command.

```
yarn list --depth=0
```

Keep in mind, levels are zero-indexed.

`yarn list --pattern <pattern>` will filter the list of dependencies by the pattern flag.

Examples:

```sh
yarn list --pattern gulp
yarn list --pattern "gulp|grunt"
yarn list --pattern "gulp|grunt" --depth=1
```
