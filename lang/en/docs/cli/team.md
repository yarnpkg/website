##### `yarn team list <scope>|<scope:team>` <a class="toc" id="toc-yarn-team-ls" href="#toc-yarn-team-ls"></a>

If performed on an organization name, will return a list of existing teams under that organization. If performed on a team, it will instead return a list of all users belonging to that particular team.

### Details <a class="toc" id="toc-details" href="#toc-details"></a>

Teams must always be fully qualified with the organization/scope they belong to when operating on them, separated by a colon (:).
For example: If you have a team named `developers` on a company named `foobar`, you should use team name like `foobar:developers` in the above `<scope:team>` commands.

yarn team always operates directly on the current registry, but you can overwrite it from the command line by using `YARN_REGISTRY="<url-to-your-registry>`.

In order to create teams and manage team membership, you _must be a team admin_ under the given organization. Listing teams and team memberships may be done by any member of the organizations.

Organization creation and management of team admins and organization members is done through the npm website, not the CLI.

To use teams to manage permissions on packages belonging to your organization, use the yarn access command to grant or revoke the appropriate permissions.
