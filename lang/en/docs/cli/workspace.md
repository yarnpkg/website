##### `yarn workspace <workspace_name> <command>` <a class="toc" id="toc-yarn-workspace" href="#toc-yarn-workspace"></a>

This will run the chosen Yarn command in the selected workspace.

Example:

```sh
yarn workspace awesome-package add react react-dom --dev
```

This will add `react` and `react-dom` as `devDependencies` in your `packages/awesome-package/package.json`.

If you want to remove a package:

```sh
yarn workspace web-project remove some-package --save
```

The example above would remove `some-package` from `packages/web-project/package.json`.
