<p class="lead">Manage package owners.</p>

### What is a package owner? <a class="toc" id="toc-what-is-a-package-owner" href="#toc-what-is-a-package-owner"></a>

A package "owner" in the registry is a user that has access to make changes to
a package. A single package can have as many owners as you want.

Owners have permission to do the following tasks:

1. Publish new versions of the package
2. Add or remove other owners of the package
3. Change metadata for a package

### Caveats <a class="toc" id="toc-caveats" href="#toc-caveats"></a>

There aren't any other levels of access at this time. All users can either
modify a package or they cannot. In the future, there may be more types of
roles, but not at this time.

##### `yarn owner ls <package>` <a class="toc" id="toc-yarn-owner-ls" href="#toc-yarn-owner-ls"></a>

##### `yarn owner add <user> <package>` <a class="toc" id="toc-yarn-owner-add" href="#toc-yarn-owner-add"></a>
