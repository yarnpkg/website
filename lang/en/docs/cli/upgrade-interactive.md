<p class="lead">This is similar to npm-check interactive update mode. It provides an easy way to update outdated packages.</p>

##### `yarn upgrade-interactive [--latest]` <a class="toc" id="toc-yarn-upgrade-interactive" href="#toc-yarn-upgrade-interactive"></a>

The `upgrade-interactive` command takes the same parameters as, and functions the same as the base `upgrade` command.
This command will display the outdated packages before performing any upgrade, allowing the user to select which packages to upgrade.
Yarn will respect the version ranges in `package.json` when determining the version to upgrade to.

You can think of `yarn upgrade-interactive` as a combination of the `yarn outdated` and `yarn upgrade [package...]` commands.
Where `yarn outdated` displays the list of outdated packages and `yarn upgrade [package...]` can then be used to upgrade desired packages,
`yarn upgrade-interactive` displays the same outdated package list and lets you immediately choose which to upgrade.

`--latest` : This flag tells yarn to ignore the specified version ranges in `package.json` and instead use the version tagged `latest`
in the registry.
