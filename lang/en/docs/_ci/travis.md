[Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) detects the use of Yarn by the presence of `yarn.lock` in the repository root.
If it is available, Travis CI will install `yarn` if necessary, and execute `yarn` as the default install command.

If your install phase requires more, it is necessary to install Yarn yourself until it is pre-installed on build images.

There are a couple of ways to install Yarn; one with `sudo`, the other without.
If you are using the [container-based environment](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/ci-environment/#Virtualization-environments)
use the latter.

## `sudo`-enabled builds

```yml
sudo: required
before_install: # if "install" is overridden
  # Repo for Yarn
  - sudo apt-key adv --fetch-keys http://dl.yarnpkg.com/debian/pubkey.gpg
  - echo "deb http://dl.yarnpkg.com/debian/ stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/yarn.list
  - sudo apt-get update -qq
  - sudo apt-get install -y -qq yarn
cache:
  yarn: true
```

## container-based builds

Container-based builds do not have the `sudo` privilege, so they must rely on other means to install.
For example:

```yaml
sudo: false
before_install:
  - curl -o- -L https://yarnpkg.com/install.sh | bash -s -- --version {{site.latest_version}}
  - export PATH=$HOME/.yarn/bin:$PATH
cache:
  yarn: true
```
