## Configuring your package <a class="toc" id="toc-configuring-your-package" href="#toc-configuring-your-package"></a>

Yarn looks for `package.json` files to identify each package and configure the behavior of yarn while running inside that package.

An example configuration for the `pet-kitten` package, which would be found at `pet-kitten/package.json`:

```
{
  "name": "pet-kitten",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "main": "pet.js",
  "dependencies": {
    "hand": "1.0.0"
  }
}
```

## Use `yarn.lock` to pin your dependencies <a class="toc" id="toc-use-yarn-lock-to-pin-your-dependencies" href="#toc-use-yarn-lock-to-pin-your-dependencies"></a>

Yarn also uses a `yarn.lock` file in the root of your project to make dependency resolution fast and reliable. You never need to touch this file- yarn owns it and will change it when managing dependencies.

To make sure your app works consistently, **you should always save the `yarn.lock` file in your code repository.**
