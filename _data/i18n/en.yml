homepage_tagline: Fast, reliable, and secure dependency management.

homepage_feature_fast_title: Ultra Fast.
homepage_feature_fast_description: |
  Yarn caches every package it downloads so it never needs to again. It also
  parallelizes operations to maximize resource utilization so install times are
  faster than ever.

homepage_feature_secure_title: Mega Secure.
homepage_feature_secure_description: |
  Yarn uses checksums to verify the integrity of every installed package
  before its code is executed.

homepage_feature_reliable_title: Super Reliable.
homepage_feature_reliable_description: |
  Using a detailed, but concise, lockfile format, and a deterministic algorithm
  for installs, Yarn is able to guarantee that an install that worked on one
  system will work exactly the same way on any other system.

  the same.
homepage_featurette_network_resillience_title: Network Resilience
