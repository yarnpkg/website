We're pleased to announce the open source release of Yarn, a collaboration between [Facebook][], [Exponent][], [Google][], and [Tilde][]. With Yarn, engineers still have access to the npm registry, but can install packages more quickly and manage dependencies consistently across machines or in secure offline environments. Yarn enables engineers to move faster and with confidence when using shared code so they can focus on what matters â€” building new products and features. Read the full announcement on [code.facebook.com](https://code.facebook.com/posts/1840075619545360).
